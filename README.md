# Movie-recommendation-system

Implemented two movie recommendation systems in Jupyter notebook.  
Used the movie lens dataset https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/  
Extraxted User and Item IDs and movie ratings corresponding to them  
Performed data cleaning by removing duplicate items and did some basic Exploratory Data Analysis to find trends and any outliers  

Two recommendation methods used are:
1. Finding correlation in movies and suggesting movies most correlated to a given movie
2. Memory based Collaborative filtering algorithm with cosine similarity
